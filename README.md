# HurricaneDamageRecognition
Submission for EY Data Science Challenge 2024

## Objective 
To develop a machine learning model to identify and detect “damaged” and “un-damaged” coastal infrastructure (residential and commercial buildings), which have been impacted by natural calamities such as hurricanes, cyclones, etc. 

## Notes
- Clouds appear as saturated (dark) regions in each color band. Pre-storm image has more clouds than post storm image. 

## Challenges
- No cloud masking available, although there are clouds in the images.  

## Appenxdix
- TIFF: Tag Image File Format. Lossless form of file compression (no image quality loss).
